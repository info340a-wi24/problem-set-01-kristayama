<p>Snoopy is a dog from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts">Peanuts Franchise</a> which consists of comic strips, multiple tv shows, movies, and more.
Snoopy's breed is a beagle and is known to have an angsty and funny personality. 
His owner is Charlie Brown and he is often seen hanging out with Woodstock, a yellow bird.
Snoopy lives in a doghouse, but he is frequently seen layng atop the roof, rather than inside.</p>

<p>Reasons why I admire and love Snoopy: 
    <ul>
        <li>He is very cute in appearance.</li>
        <li>I think it's funny that he <important-list>sleeps on top of his house</important-list>.</li>
        <li>His sometimes sassy and indignant personality is relatable!</li>
    </ul>
